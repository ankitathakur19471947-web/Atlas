Build a full-stack web application prototype for SIH Problem Statement PS-25018: 
“FRA Atlas and Decision Support System for Tribal Development”.

Tech Stack:
- Frontend: React.js
- Backend: Node.js + Express
- Database: Use SQLite or JSON as mock database (demo purpose).
- Map: Leaflet.js (render interactive GIS map).
- AI: Mock OCR + Mock Satellite Mapping (use pre-filled sample data).

Features to implement:
1. Landing Page:
   - Title: “FRA Atlas & DSS Prototype”
   - Navigation: Home, Atlas, DSS Dashboard.

2. FRA Digitization Module (Demo):
   - Upload scanned FRA document (PDF/Image).
   - Instead of real OCR, simulate by extracting mock text (e.g., “Patta Holder: Ramesh, Village: Gondia, Area: 2 hectares”).
   - Save extracted data into SQLite/JSON database.

3. FRA Atlas (WebGIS Portal):
   - Interactive map (Leaflet.js) with village boundaries.
   - Show mock shapefiles/GeoJSON of FRA plots.
   - Layers:
     • FRA claims (granted vs pending) – color coded.
     • Assets (ponds, farms, forest) – use icons/markers.

4. Asset Mapping (AI Simulation):
   - For demo, hardcode some asset data (e.g., “Village Gondia: 2 ponds, 1 forest patch, 5 farms”).
   - Display these assets as layers on the map.

5. DSS Engine (Decision Support System):
   - Rule-based recommendations:
       • If water index low → recommend Jal Jeevan Mission.
       • If farmland present but no scheme → recommend PM-Kisan.
       • If degraded forest → recommend MGNREGA Plantation.
   - Display recommendations in a Dashboard view.

6. Dashboard:
   - Show FRA claims count, assets mapped, schemes suggested.
   - Use charts (Recharts or Chart.js).

Integration Flow:
- React frontend fetches map layers + data via Express API.
- Express serves mock database (claims, assets, DSS results).
- Leaflet renders interactive Atlas with FRA + assets.
- Dashboard pulls summary data from backend.

Design:
- Use earthy green theme (tribal + forest).
- Place SIH 2025 logo placeholder on navbar.
- Keep UI simple and minimal for demo.

Deliverables:
- Full-stack web app running on Replit.
- Mock demo showing FRA document digitization, GIS map, and DSS scheme recommendations.
